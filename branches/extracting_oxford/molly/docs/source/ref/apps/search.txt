:mod:`molly.apps.search` -- Whole site search
=============================================

.. module :: molly.apps.search

The search application allows the user to enter a query and retrieve results
from across the site. Results are produced by the application's providers,
and may determine results in whatever manner they choose.

Search providers may access an index for the entire site, or be
application-specific. An institution may have a `Google Search Appliance
<http://www.google.co.uk/enterprise/gsa/>`_ from which results are retrieved,
or alternatively they may wish searches for ISBNs to go straight to a library
catalogue page.

To use, place the following in your :doc:`settings module </topics/settings>`::

    APPLICATIONS = [
        # ...
        Application('molly.apps.search', 'search',
            providers = [
                '...',  # paths to search provider backends
            ],
        ),
        # ...
    ]

Search results
--------------

Individual search results are represented as dictionaries where the following
keys have particular meanings:

:const:`url` (*required*)
    The local part of the URL for the page. Will be used as an :attr:`href`.
:const:`title` (*required*)
    The page title.
:const:`application` (*recommended*)
    The name of the application that handles the URL. May be used to display
    an icon next to each result.
:const:`excerpt`
    The bit of the page relevant to the query. May contain HTML (i.e. should
    be marked safe in a template).
:const:`additional`
    More information about the resource represented at the URL. For example,
    the :mod:`~molly.apps.places` application returns the type of entity and
    a distance from the user's location.
:const:`redirect_if_sole_result`
    A boolean, default :const:`False`, which will cause the search page to
    redirect to the URL if only one result is returned.
:const:`exclude_from_search`
    A boolean, default :const:`False`, which will exclude the page from any
    displayed search results. Can be used to exclude irrelevant results or
    those not intended for mobile devices.

You may define any other keys as you see fit, though these won't be utilised
in the default templates, requiring you to implement your own. If you believe
that there's scope for more standardisation, please :doc:`raise a ticket
</topics/tickets>` or :doc:`start a discussion on the developer list
</topics/development>`.

Search providers
----------------

Providers should extend the
:class:`~molly.apps.search.providers.BaseSearchProvider` interface:

.. class :: molly.apps.search.providers.BaseSearchProvider

   .. method :: perform_search(self, request, query, application=None)

      Takes a :class:`django.http.HttpRequest` object, a :class:`unicode`
      query and an application name. This method should be overridden to
      return a list of results as defined above.

:class:`~molly.apps.search.providers.BaseSearchProvider` also provides the
following utility methods you may find useful in your implementations:

.. class :: molly.apps.search.providers.BaseSearchProvider

   .. method :: get_metadata(self, url)
   
      .. note ::
      
         Still needs to be implemented.

      Resolves the given :data:`url` to the view that would handle it and
      returns the result of calling
      :meth:`~molly.utils.views.BaseView.get_metadata` on that view.

The search form
---------------

Queries are processed through :class:`~molly.apps.search.forms.SearchForm`:

.. class :: molly.apps.search.forms.SearchForm

   .. attribute :: query
   
      A :class:`~django.forms.CharField` taking the search query.

Defined views
-------------

This application defines just one view:

.. class :: molly.apps.search.views.IndexView(request)

   Presents a single-field form to the user, and where a query has been
   submitted retrieves results from all configured search providers.
   
   Results from multiple providers are presented in the order they were
   configured, i.e. the topmost configured provider's results are given
   precedence. Where more than one provider returns the same result, metadata
   are combined (with the location given by its first occurance) and only one
   result is displayed.
   
   This view renders to the :file:`search/index.html` template, passing a
   :class:`~molly.apps.search.forms.SearchForm` instance as :data:`form` and
   (where a search has been performed) a list of results as :data:`results`.
   
Templates
---------

:file:`search/base.html`

   Extends :file:`base.html`.

:file:`search/index.html`

   Extends :file:`search/base.html` and renders the search form and results.
   The template presents results in an ordered list (``<ol>``), including
   :file:`search/result.html` within a list item element (``<li>``) for each
   for each result in :data:`results`.

   
:file:`search/result.html`

   By default, renders ``title``, ``additional`` and ``excerpt`` inside a
   :samp:`<div class="search-result search-result-{appname}">`.
   
Currently implemented providers
-------------------------------

:class:`molly.providers.apps.search.GSASearchProvider`
    Pulls results from a Google Search Appliance.
:class:`molly.providers.apps.search.ApplicationSearchProvider`
    For each installed application :samp:`{foo}`, calls
    :samp:`{foo}.search.perform_search` and catenates the returned results.
