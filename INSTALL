Installation
============

Molly is intended to be used with virtualenv and pip. However, before dealing
with the Python side of the installation you'll need to install the following
Debian packages or their equivalents for your distribution or OS:

 * postgis
 * python-gdal
 * proj
 * libgeos-3.0.0 or higher
 * binutils
 * libgdal1-1.5.0
 * postgresql-8.3
 * postgresql-8.3-postgis
 * postgresql-server-dev-8.3
 * python-virtualenv
 * python-setuptools
 * python-dev
 * libxslt-dev
 * libldap2-dev
 * libsasl2-dev

postgis python-gdal proj libgeos-3.0.0 binutils libgdal1-1.5.0 postgresql-8.3 postgresql-8.3-postgis postgresql-server-dev-8.3 python-virtualenv python-setuptools python-dev libxslt-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev

Unfortunately, pip isn't yet in Debian stable, so you'll need to install it
using easy_install:

 $ aptitude install python-setuptools
 $ easy_install pip

Next, set up and activate a virtualenv. This has been automated as
scripts/install_virtualenv.py. If you want to do this by hand, do the following:

     $ virtualenv --no-site-packages ~/mollyenv
     $ cd ~/mollyenv
     $ source bin/activate

    Next, clone the git repository to a temporary directory:

     $ git clone git://mollyproject.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/mollyproject/mollyproject

    Install the Molly dependencies and Molly itself:

     $ cd ~/mollyenv/mollyproject/branches/extracting_oxford/molly/
     $ pip -E ~/mollyenv/ install `cat requirements/core.txt` --upgrade
     $ python setup.py install

Once you've set up the database as below, you'll be able to run the development
server as follows:

 $ cd ~/mollyenv/mollyproject/branches/extracting_oxford/molly/demos/molly_oxford
 $ python manage.py runserver



Database
--------

There are two ways to create the PostGIS template used by a molly installation:

 * Run one of the scripts in scripts/ as the postgis user.
OR
 * Follow the instructions at
   http://geodjango.org/docs/install.html#creating-a-spatial-database-template-for-postgis

The first one is likely the simpler, but if it fails the latter will provide
more information to get it working.

Once this is done, you should create the molly database as a DB superuser
(e.g. as postgres) by executing the following:

 $ createdb -T template_postgis molly

As a DB superuser, create the molly user:


(Make sure the password is the one given in settings.py in the demos folder)

 $ createuser molly -P
 Enter password for new role:
 Enter it again:
 Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
 Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
 Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n


Now edit pg_hba.conf (usually in /var/lib/pgsql/data) on Fedora systems, and
/etc/postgresql/8.3/main/ on Debian systems) to allow passworded logins from
the new user by adding the following line somewhere near the top.

 local molly molly md5

Order is important, so it needs to go above any more general access directives.

Log in to the server as postgres and allow the user access to the database:

 $ psql molly
 Welcome to psql 8.3.7, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

 Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
        \h for help with SQL commands
        \? for help with psql commands
        \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
        \q to quit

 molly=# grant all on database molly to molly;
 GRANT
 molly=# ^D

Either send SIGHUP or restart the server to reload pg_hba.conf

Change directory to your project directory and use manage.py to initialise the
database:

 $ cd /path/to/molly/project/
 $ python manage.py syncdb

It should ask you to create a new superuser. Say yes and set one up.

The site also requires a cache directory, currently /var/cache/molly .
Create this directory and give user www-data and/or your developer users/group
all permissions to do things to it.
