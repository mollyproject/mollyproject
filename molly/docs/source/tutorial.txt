Getting started
===============

The Molly framework is designed so that the least you have to do is choose the
features you wish to expose, write some connectors, and create a base template.

We'll start with how to acquire and install the code, before moving on to 
getting the demonstration site working. After that we'll explore some basic
customisation and deployment issues.

Getting the code
----------------

Molly is distributed under an :doc:`Academic Free License v3.0 <license>` and
is maintained in a Git repository at SourceForge. Releases 0.1 and 0.2 are
specific to the University of Oxford, and work on 0.3 is ongoing. Instructions
for accessing the Git repository can be found on `the project pages
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/mollyproject/develop>`_. You may perform an
anonymous clone by using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $  git clone git://mollyproject.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/mollyproject/mollyproject

The repository contains two directories, :file:`molly/` and
:file:`mollyproject.org/`; the former containing the Molly framework, and the
latter the website. For the rest of this tutorial we assume you are working
relative to :file:`molly/`. 

Installing the dependencies
---------------------------

We recommend the use of `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_ and `virtualenv
<http://virtualenv.openplans.org/>`_ for deployment, though you may install
Molly into your :file:`site-packages` directly. We'll assume you're using
:file:`~/mollyenv` as your virtual environment.

Molly has a few non-Python dependencies not provided by pip. These should be
installed system-wide using your default package manager (or from source). For
example, Debian users would perform [#f1]_:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ apt-get install postgis python-gdal proj libgeos-3.0.0 binutils \
         libgdal1-1.5.0 postgresql-8.3 postgresql-8.3-postgis \
         postgresql-server-dev-8.3 python-virtualenv python-setuptools \
         python-dev libxslt-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev
         
This installation assumes version 8.3 of PostgreSQL, but 8.4 is also known to
work.

Installing pip
--------------

To use pip, Debian users must first install setuptools:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ apt-get install python-setuptools
   $ easy_install pip
   
Fedora users may install pip directly:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ yum install python-pip

Creating and configuring a database
-----------------------------------

Molly is targeted at using a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extensions. For
details on how to set this up, please consult `the GeoDjango installation
documentation <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/install/>`_.

Assuming your PostGIS template is called `postgis_template` you can now set up
a database:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo su postgres
   $ createdb -T template_postgis molly
   $ createuser molly -P
   Enter password for new role:
   Enter it again:
   Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
   Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
   Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
   $ psql molly
   Welcome to psql 8.3.7, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

   Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
          \h for help with SQL commands
          \? for help with psql commands
          \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
          \q to quit

   molly=# grant all on database molly to molly;
   GRANT
   molly=# ^D

You may need to add your new user to :file:`pg_hba.conf` (usually in
/var/lib/pgsql/data) on Fedora systems, and /etc/postgresql/8.3/main/ on
Debian systems). To do so, add the following line somewhere near the top of
the file::

   local molly molly md5

Once this is done, reload the configuration by restarting the ``PostgreSQL``
server or sending it a SIGHUP:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ killall -SIGHUP postgresql

Deploying molly
---------------

Molly comes with a script to deploy the :package:``molly`` Python package and
the demonstration sites to a virtual environment, along with its Python
dependencies. Using ``virtualenv`` enables you to have multiple parallel
deployments using different versions of dependencies, increasing
reproducability of deployments.

The script takes one argument, the path to deploy to. It first creates a new
virtual environment, then uses ``pip`` to install dependencies as listed in
:file:`molly/requirements/core.txt`. On Debian systems it skips ``PyCairo``
and attempts to symlink to a system-wide version. Finally it installs ``molly``
and copies the :file:`demos` folder to the root of the virtual environment. 

.. code-block:: none

   $ cd molly/
   $ scripts/install_virtualenv.py ~/mollyenv

   Molly was successfully installed to /home/alex/testdeploy.
   The following command will take you inside your virtualenv:

      $ source ~/mollyenv/bin/activate

Problems with the installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's likely that at least one of these will fail. If one does, the output of
all the commands run can be found in :file:`molly.stdout.log` and
:file:`molly.stderr.log` in the directory where you ran the installer.

To fix things manually, first 'activate' the python interpreter in the virtual
environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ source ~/mollyenv/bin/activate
   (mollyenv)$
   
Next you may wish to download source packages or rerun pip. The python
interpreter you invoke will work relative to your new virtualenv.

Once you are finished, 'deactivate' your virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   (mollyenv)$ deactivate
   $ 

Finally, `file a bug
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=309230&atid=1302249>`_ or
`post to the developer or user mailing list
<http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=309230>`_ to let the developers know
what went wrong, so we can make things a little better next time round.

Running a demo site
-------------------

At the moment there is only one demo site, kept in :file:`demos/molly_oxford/`.

To run it:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd ~/mollyenv/
   $ source bin/activate
   $ export PYTHONPATH=~/mollyenv/demos/
   $ cd demos/molly_oxford/
   $ ./manage.py syncdb
   $ ./manage.py runserver

If all has gone smoothly, you should be able to point a web browser at
`http://localhost:8000/ <http://localhost:8000/>`_.



.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] If deploying to Debian, you will also need to install
         ``python-cairo``, as the Python Package Index doesn't provide a
         version of ``PyCairo`` compatible with Debian Lenny. The Molly
         installer (described later) will then create a symbolic link from
         your virtual environment to ``PyCairo`` in your system
         ``site-packages``.
