Application media
=================

.. note:: This is information for people developing applications and wanting to
          use Molly's media framework. If you're just interested in customising
          the look and feel of Molly, see the :doc:`customising tutorial <../getting-started/customising>`.

Molly uses `django-staticfiles <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-staticfiles>`_
and `django-compress <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-compress>`_ to collate
and merge media files from various sources.

Source media locations
----------------------

A set of base media are pulled in from :file:`molly/media/`. Each molly
application may also define a :file:`media/` subdirectory, from which Molly
will pull media related to that particular application. Finally, the site may
provide additional media to override the defaults in
:file:`<project_root>/site_media/`.

In each of these locations media are organised within a directory bearing the
name of the application that uses them. For example::

    molly/apps/contact/
      media/
        contact/
          css/
            [...]
          js/
            [...]
          images/
            [...]
    
    molly/
      media/
        base/
          css/
            [...]
          [...]
    
    your_site/
      site_media/
        contact/
          images/
            override_some_icon.png
        base/
          css/
            [Add your own style here]

Collating media
---------------

Media are collated into :const:`settings.STATIC_ROOT`, which is defined to be
the same as :const:`settings.MEDIA_ROOT`. To invoke ``django-staticfiles`` to
collate the media:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python manange.py build_static -l --noinput
   
The ``-l`` option causes it to use symlinks instead of copying files. This has
the added advantage that when editing your media during development you don't
have to invoke ``build_static`` after every change.

.. note::

   You will however need to invoke ``build_static`` if you add new media files,
   so as to create the new symlinks from :const:`~settings.STATIC_ROOT`.

Compressing media
-----------------

Molly encourages the use of ``django-compress`` to merge and tidy up CSS and
JavaScript files. Media are merged into a directory :file:`c/` within
:const:`~settings.STATIC_ROOT`, with the first fragment of the path removed.

``django-compress`` also adds a timestamp to each compressed file's filename.

Thus, :file:`contact/css/index.css` and :file:`base/css/index.css` would be
merged into :file:`c/css/index.r12345678.css`.

To reference the combined media group from a template you should load the
``compressed`` template library using ``{% load compressed %}``
at the beginning of the template file. You may then use
``{% compressed_js <group-name> %}`` and ``{% compressed_css <group-name> %}``
to generate the required ``<script/>`` and ``<link rel="stylesheet"\>`` tags.

The group name is the hyphenated path within the :file:`c/` directory without
any ``js-`` or ``css-`` prefix. Thus :file:`contact/css/types/clever.css` would
have a group of ``types-clever``.

.. note::

   For more information about ``django-compress``, please see `their
   documentation <http://code.google.com/p/django-compress/>`_.

``django-compress`` will automatically update the generated files if it
discovers that a constituent file has changed on disk. However, if you want to
sync them manually, it can be invoked as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python manage.py synccompress

To only enable compression when not in ``DEBUG`` mode, use the following line
in your settings file:

.. code-block:: python

   COMPRESS = not DEBUG
