"""Custom Django test runner that runs the tests using the
XMLTestRunner class.

The main reason that made me come up with this project in the first place was
to make it easier to manage the build cycle of my Django applications. Since
I already use Hudson to build my JavaEE applications, it would be nice to
leverage my current setup to handle my Django applications as well.

This script shows how to use the XMLTestRunner in a Django project. To know
how to configure a custom TestRunner in a Django project, please read the
Django docs website.

To fine tune this script, put one or more of the following settings in your
project's 'settings.py' file:

 - TEST_OUTPUT_VERBOSE (default: False)
    Besides the XML reports generated by the test runner, a bunch of useful
    information is printed to the sys.stderr stream, just like the
    TextTestRunner does. Use this setting to choose between a verbose and a
    non-verbose output.

 - TEST_OUTPUT_DESCRIPTIONS (default: False)
    If your test methods contains docstrings, you can display such docstrings
    instead of display the test name (ex: module.TestCase.test_method). In
    order to use this feature, you have to enable verbose output by setting
    TEST_OUTPUT_VERBOSE = True.

 - TEST_OUTPUT_DIR (default:'.')
    Tells the test runner where to put the XML reports. If the directory
    couldn't be found, the test runner will try to create it before
    generate the XML files.
